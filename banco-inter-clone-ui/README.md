## ðŸ›  Technologies

Project was built using **React Native** and **Typescript** in addition to the following dependencies:

- **[ESLint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint)** - Is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions

- **[Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)** - Is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

- **[React Native Gesture Handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-gesture-handler)** - Declarative API exposing platform native touch and gesture system to React Native.

- **[React Native Reanimated](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-reanimated)** - Provides a more comprehensive, low level abstraction for the Animated library API to be built on top of and hence allow for much greater flexibility especially when it comes to gesture based interactions.

- **[React Native Safe Area Context](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-safe-area-context)** - A flexible way to handle safe area, also works on Android and Web!

- **[React Native Screens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-safe-area-context)** - This project aims to expose native navigation container components to React Native.

- **[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)** - Allow you to write real CSS in your JavaScript. This means you can use all the CSS features you use and love, including (but not limited to) media queries, all pseudo selectors, nesting, etc.
